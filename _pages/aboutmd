## Hello! I'm Mumu 👋

I'm a medical doctor by training, originally from Indonesia, now calling Copenhagen home since 2019.

### What I Do

- 🏥 **Health Education**: Moderating and speaking at health webinars
- ✈️ **Travel Content**: Documenting our family adventures across Europe
- 🎥 **Content Creation**: YouTube videos, Instagram posts, and Threads about life in Denmark
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Family Life**: Sharing our expat journey and Danish culture

### Find Me Online

I'm most active on [YouTube](#), [Instagram](#), and [Threads](#) where I share a mix of health tips, travel guides, recipes, and daily life in Scandinavia.
