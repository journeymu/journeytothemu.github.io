Hello and welcome to my new website!

I'm so excited to finally have a central place to share all my content - from health tips to travel adventures, from webinar recordings to family recipes.

## What You'll Find Here

This website will be your go-to resource for:

- **Health & Wellness**: Evidence-based health tips from a medical doctor's perspective
- **Travel Stories**: Our family adventures exploring Denmark and beyond
- **Life in Denmark**: Expat life, Danish culture, and everything in between
- **Webinars**: Recordings and highlights from health education sessions
- **Recipes**: Family-friendly recipes we love

## Why "Journey to the Mu"?

My nickname is Mumu, and this website represents my journey - from practicing medicine in Indonesia to creating content in Copenhagen. It's about the journey, not just the destination.

Stay tuned for more content coming soon!
